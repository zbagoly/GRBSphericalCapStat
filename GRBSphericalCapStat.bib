ABSTRACT = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous objects known: they outshine their host galaxies, making them ideal candidates for probing large-scale structure. Our aim is to determine the Spatial Two-Point Correlation Function of the GRBs with spectroscopic redshifts. We used all observations till 4 June 2021, and we also split the data according to the origin of the redshift (afterglow or host galaxy). We analyzed the possible correlation between the GRB redshift and sky position. There is only one region, called the Faraway GRB Patch, where nine distant GRBs shows deviation from the randomness with an &asymp;1% significance, showing that the sky and the radial component of the GRB distribution could be factorized and both can be determined independently. The GRBs&rsquo; cumulative monthly distribution was used to show that it is impossible to synthesize the Sky Exposure Function, even from the perfect observational logs. We estimated the Sky Exposure Function using the Gaussian kernel, and with the radial distribution, it was used for the estimation of the Spatial Two-Point Correlation Function. Monte Carlo simulations were used to determine the Poissonian errors. Our result shows that the current Spatial Two-Point Correlation Function estimations are consistent with zero for the full and the afterglow/host galaxy datasets.},

ABSTRACT = {We explore large-scale cosmic structure using the spatial distribution of 542 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) having accurately-measured positions and spectroscopic redshifts. Prominent cosmological clusters are identified in both the northern and southern galactic hemispheres (avoiding extinction effects in the plane of the Milky Way) using the Bootstrap Point-Radius method.  The Northern Galactic hemisphere contains a significant group of four GRBs in the redshift range $0.59 \le z \le 0.62$ (with a Bootstrap probability of $p=0.012$) along with the previously-identified Hercules--Corona Borealis Great Wall (in the revised redshift range $0.9 \le z \le 2.1$; $p=0.017$). The Southern Galactic hemisphere contains the previously-identified Giant GRB Ring ($p=0.022$) along with another possible cluster of $7-9$ GRBs at $1.17 \le z \le 1.444$ ($p=0.031$).  Additionally, both the Hercules--Corona Borealis Great Wall and the Giant GRB Ring have become more prominent as the GRB sample size has grown.  The approach used here underscores the potential value of GRB clustering as a probe of large-scale cosmic structure, complementary to galaxy and quasar clustering. Because of the vast scale on which GRB clustering provides valuable insights, it is important that optical GRB monitoring continue so that additional spectroscopic redshift measurements should be obtained.},
